# this code will generate random data for the 'orders' table

order_date = str(order_day) + "-" + order_month + "-" + order_year
#print(order_date)

#here's the list of acceptable products
prods = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

#here's the list of acceptable customers
custs = list(range(1,16)) # this produces a list of values from 1 to 15



import random  # needed to generate randome numbers

    # now create a new order
    ordernum = ordernum + 1
    order_day = random.randint(1,28)  # so we don't end up with "31-Feb" or the like
    order_month = random.choice(["Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec"])
    order_year = "2014"

    sql = "INSERT INTO orders (order_id, order_date, customer_id) VALUES (" + \
          str(ordernum) + ", '" + \
          order_date + "', " + \
	  str(random.choice(custs)) + ");\n"
    f.write(sql)

    #now create a random number of items in each order
    num_items = random.randint(1,4)

# note: a bug here is that the same item might be added to the order twice, 
# violating the primary key of the 'order_lines' table. there are a few ways
# you might fix this.  i leave it as a challenge to the reader.
